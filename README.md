# ConViT

ConViT is a novel hybrid architecture that synergizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) to harness their combined strengths for remote sensing hyperspectral classification.

//Our paper is currently undergoing review, and we're eager to share the source code with you once it's published. Keep an eye out for updates!
